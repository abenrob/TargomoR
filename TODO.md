## General To Do

* match time outputs back to input data
* think about inputs for `callTargomoAPI` - should just be body, not sources etc?
* rewrite `derive*` functions if not working efficiently?
* sort out middle of `createRequestBody`
* use `testthat` and `covr`
* move api_key and region inputs to end throughout?
* options to format time output as "hms" etc?
* Do something with the headers as well as the content of the response.
