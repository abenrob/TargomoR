## General To Do

* move api_key and region inputs to end throughout?
* Reuse code across the `getTargomo*` functions
* add more tests
* rewrite `derive*` functions if not working efficiently?
* sort out middle of `createRequestBody`
* options to format time output as "hms" etc?
* Do something with the headers as well as the content of the response.
